But today, for some reason, I decided to pick up this journal. Maybe it’s because I’m tired of dreaming and not remembering. Or maybe it’s because of him. Zayan Rizvan. The human embodiment of chaos and confidence. He’s always there, in the corner of my eye, laughing with his friends, planning his next adventure, or stuffing his face with some new food he’s discovered. We’ve barely spoken, but I can’t help noticing him. And then there’s the mural. The one that seems to whisper when no one’s looking. I don’t know why I keep coming back to it. It’s just a wall, really. Graffiti-covered and crumbling at the edges. But every time I look at it, it feels… different. Like it’s alive. Last night, I swear it whispered my name.
