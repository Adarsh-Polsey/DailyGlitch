Billionaire Elon Musk and OpenAI jointly proposed a trial in December, according to a federal court filing on Friday.

The parties agreed to delay a decision on whether the expedited case will be decided by a jury or solely by the judge, said the filing in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

The judge this month denied Musk’s request to pause the artificial intelligence group’s transition to a for-profit model but agreed to an expedited trial in the autumn, the latest turn in the high-stakes legal fight.

“We welcome the court’s March 4 decision rejecting Elon Musk’s latest attempt to slow down OpenAI for his personal benefit,” OpenAI said in a blog post on Friday.

Musk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 but left before the company took off and subsequently founded the competing startup xAI in 2023.''',
'''A London court hearing, reported to be Apple’s appeal against a British government order to create a “back door” to its encrypted cloud storage systems, was held in secret on Friday, with media not allowed to attend despite a formal request.

In February, The Washington Post reported that Britain had issued a “technical capability notice” to the tech firm to enable access to encrypted messages and photos, even for users outside the country.

The iPhone maker in response removed its most advanced security encryption for cloud data, called Advanced Data Protection, for new users in Britain.

Details of the case have been shrouded in secrecy, and neither Apple nor the British government has publicly confirmed the technical capability notice.

The BBC reported a hearing on Friday simply listed as “an application in private” at the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, a court that considers allegations of unlawful intrusion by public bodies, was Apple’s appeal against this order.

There was no confirmation of what parties were involved, although James Eadie, who represents the government in its most serious legal cases, attended. He declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A lawyer representing 10 media organisations, including Reuters and the BBC, submitted an application to the tribunal for the case to be held in public.

The court confirmed receipt of his email but he was not invited to appear before the judges to make any further submissions on Friday, and no reporters were allowed in the courtroom. The hearing concluded after about six hours.''',

'''After spending nine months aboard the International Space Station (ISS), NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are finally on track for their long-awaited return to Earth. A replacement crew launched on Friday evening, paving the way for the duo’s homecoming after what was initially expected to be a short-term mission.

SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket took off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 7:03 pm. ET, carrying four astronauts who will take over operations on the ISS. This new crew includes NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, both military pilots, as well as Japan’s Takuya Onishi and Russia’s Kirill Peskov, both former airline pilots. The incoming crew will spend the next six months at the space station, while Williams and Wilmore prepare for their return.

The extended stay of Wilmore and Williams was marked by unexpected technical issues, political attention, and personal sacrifices. As test pilots for Boeing’s new Starliner capsule, the two astronauts had launched from Cape Canaveral on June 5, 2024, with the expectation of a brief stay. However, a series of technical setbacks — including helium leaks and thruster failures on the Starliner — forced NASA and Boeing into months of investigations, ultimately ruling the capsule unsafe for a return trip.'''
