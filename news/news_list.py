    '''The chip giant NVIDIA ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.) In 2025, Nvidia has already participated in seven rounds. Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025,  organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round. The billion-dollar-round club OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. xAI:  Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI’s cap table a few months later. Inflection:  One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Wayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion.''',
    '''China is reportedly keeping DeepSeek under close watch China appears to think homegrown AI startup DeepSeek could become a notable tech success story for the country. After DeepSeek’s sudden rise to fame in January with the release of its open “reasoning” model, R1, the company is now operating under new, tighter government-influenced restrictions, according to The Information. Some of the company’s employees have been prevented from traveling abroad freely, and the Chinese government is now playing a role in screening potential investors, according to The Information. DeepSeek is enforcing the travel restrictions by having its parent company, quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer, hold onto certain staff’s passports. The developments come a few weeks after it was reported that the Chinese government was instructing AI researchers and entrepreneurs to avoid traveling to the U.S., fearing the loss of trade secrets.''',
    '''Flock Safety and one of its long-time VCs, Bedrock Capital, announced Thursday that the startup raised a fresh $275 million at a $7.5 billion valuation. Flock makes computer vision-enabled video surveillance technology used by law enforcement as well as businesses, property management companies, and so on. It’s best known for its automatic license plate recognition tech, but Flock also makes gunshot detection tech marketed to schools, and recently acquired public safety drone company Aerodome. Flock was founded in 2017 and went through Y Combinator that same year. Growth exploded in the subsequent years. Flock crossed over $300 million in annual recurring revenue last year, which is 70% year-over-year growth, Flock spokesperson Holly Beilin told TechCrunch. The Atlanta-based startup has now raised over $950 million in total funding, according to PitchBook data, and its last valuation a year ago was $4.8 billion. Return investors Andreessen Horowitz, Greenoaks, Meritech Capital, Matrix Partners, and Y Combinator participated in this round. Given that it makes surveillance tech, Flock has unsurprisingly had its share of controversies. For instance, the ACLU cited concerns with Flock over the kind of mass surveillance it enables and, a year ago, urged the company to allow independent review of its products. Privacy advocates in Norfolk, Virginia are currently suing to stop Flock from being deployed there. Flock is also facing a wrongful termination lawsuit from a sitting mayor of a small California town, as TechCrunch recently reported.''',
    '''Y Combinator, one of the world’s most prolific startup accelerators, sent a letter on Wednesday urging the Trump administration to openly support Europe’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), a wide-ranging piece of legislation that aims to crack open Big Tech’s market power. The DMA designates six tech companies as “gatekeepers” to the internet — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, and Microsoft — and limits these technology kingpins from engaging in anticompetitive tactics on their platforms, in favor of interoperability. The law became applicable in May 2023, and it’s already had a major impact on American tech companies. In a letter to the White House posted on X by YC’s head of Public Policy, Luther Lowe, the startup accelerator argued that the DMA shouldn’t be lumped in with other European tech legislation, which U.S. officials often criticize as being overbearing. Instead, YC argues in the letter that the spirit of Europe’s DMA is in line with values that promote — not hinder — American innovation. “[W]e respectfully urge the White House to recalibrate its stance toward Europe’s digital regulation, drawing a clear line between measures that hamper innovation and those that foster it,” states YC’s letter, which was also signed by YC-backed startups, independent tech companies, and trade associations. It’s not entirely surprising that YC would come out in explicit public support of the DMA. After all, the accelerator markets itself as a champion of “Little Tech” — an American venture-backed ecosystem of technology startups. YC argues in the letter that the DMA opens up key avenues to create opportunities for American startups in AI, search, and consumer apps, and prevents Big Tech companies from boxing out smaller ventures.'''
    '''Apple reportedly considered building the iPhone 17 Air without ports After reporting in January that Apple is adding an “Air” option to its iPhone lineup, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman is offering more details about the upcoming slimmer iPhone. The iPhone 17 Air will launch this fall, Gurman says — and like the MacBook Air, it will be thinner than standard models, while combining high-end and low-end features. It apparently took a “herculean effort” for Apple engineers to create a skinnier phone with thinner batteries without sacrificing battery life. Gurman also reports that Apple considered making this the first “completely port-free iPhone,” with all charging done wirelessly and all data syncing accomplished via the cloud. However, Apple decided not to go this route, at least for now, due in part to concerns about how European regulators — who have mandated that smartphone makers support USB-C connectors — might respond.''',
    '''Meta won a legal victory this week against Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former employee who recently published a memoir of her time at the company titled “Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism.” An arbitrator ruled that the company has made a valid argument that Wynn-Williams, who worked at Facebook (now Meta) from 2011 to 2017, may have violated the non-disparagement agreement she signed when leaving the company. The ruling states that Wynn-Williams is temporarily prohibited from promoting — or, “to the extent within [her] control, from further publishing or distributing” — her book until private arbitration concludes. However, “Careless People” remains available for purchase, and may in fact be benefitting from the “Streisand Effect,” in which attempts to suppress information only serve to further publicize it. As of Sunday afternoon, “Careless People” was the number three bestselling book on Amazon. Macmillan, which published “Careless People” through its imprint Flatiron Books, said in a statement that the arbitrator’s decision “has no impact” on the publisher and that it will “absolutely continue to support and promote” the book. The publisher added that it is “appalled by Meta’s tactics to silence [its] author through the use of a non-disparagement clause in a severance agreement.” “To be clear, the arbitrator’s order makes no reference to the claims within Careless People,” Macmillan said. “The book went through a thorough editing and vetting process, and we remain committed to publishing important books such as this.”''',
    '''In a world filled with “vibe coding,” Zach Yadegari, teen founder of Cal AI, stands in ironic, old-fashioned contrast. Ironic because Yadegari and his co-founder, Henry Langmack, are both just 18 years old and recently graduated from high school. Yet their story, so far, is a classic. Launched in May, Cal AI has generated over 5 million downloads in eight months, Yadegari says. Better still, he tells TechCrunch that the customer retention rate is over 30% and that the app generated over $2 million in revenue last month. Although TechCrunch couldn’t validate his download and revenue claims, Cal AI does have a 4.8-star rating on the Apple App Store, with 66,000 reviews, and over 1 million downloads on Google Play with a 4.8-star rating on nearly 75,000 reviews. The concept is simple: Take a picture of the food you are about to consume, and let the app log calories and macros for you. It’s not a unique idea. For instance, the big dog in calorie counting, MyFitnessPal, has its Meal Scan feature. Then there are apps like SnapCalorie, which was released in 2023 and created by the founder of Google Lens. Cal AI’s advantage, perhaps, is that it was built wholly in the age of large image models. It uses models from Anthropic and OpenAI and RAG to improve accuracy and is trained on open source food calorie and image databases from sites like GitHub. “We have found that different models are better with different foods,” Yadegari tells TechCrunch. Along the way, the founders coded through technical problems like recognizing ingredients from food packages or in jumbled bowls. The result is an app that the creators say is 90percent accurate, which appears to be good enough for many dieters.'''
