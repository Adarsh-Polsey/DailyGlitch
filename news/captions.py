    "Lost in Space: Astronauts' Extended Stay a Cosmic Joke?\n\nSunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are finally returning to Earth after nine months on the ISS. Technical issues with Boeing's Starliner capsule caused their extended stay. \n  Turns out, space travel is less 'Star Trek' and more 'Groundhog Day', except you're stuck with the same people for nine months in a tin can. No escape.\n  Talk about a bad performance review. Boeing's capsule is so terrible, it kept two people hostage in space. At least the frequent flyer miles must be insane.\n#TechNews #Innovation #Startups #Entrepreneurs #AI\n#Technology #chips #Humour #News",
    "Billionaire Cage Match: Musk vs. Altman in AI Arena\n\nElon Musk and OpenAI agreed to expedite the trial regarding OpenAI's for-profit shift, a continuation of their public dispute, with the court denying Musk's request to halt the transition.\n  So, the god of free speech wants to control AI's destiny? It's like watching two toddlers fight over who gets to destroy the planet first.\n  Musk probably regrets not trademarking 'Humanity Savior' before Altman did. Now he's stuck suing over broken promises, like the rest of us.\n#TechNews #Innovation #Startups #Entrepreneurs #AI\n#Technology #chips #Humour #News",
    "Apple's Secret Garden: UK Court Hides Encryption Fight\n\nApple's appeal against a UK government order to create a backdoor to its encrypted systems was held in secret, barring media despite formal requests. Apple removed advanced data protection for new UK users.\n  Privacy? Oh, you sweet summer child. Governments and corporations are just holding hands behind your back, sharing your secrets like trading cards.\n  Apple, the 'privacy' company, bending over backwards... or just forwards enough to keep selling overpriced gadgets? Guess we'll never know, it's a secret!\n#TechNews #Innovation #Startups #Entrepreneurs #AI\n#Technology #chips #Humour #News"
