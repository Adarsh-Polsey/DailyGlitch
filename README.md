# 🚀 Daily Glitch: The Most Chaotic News Automation Ever

Welcome to **Daily Glitch** – an AI-powered, **fully automated**, meme-infested, sarcasm-driven news generator that absolutely no one asked for. It scrapes, formats, and posts news like a **soulless machine**, because who needs human journalists anymore? 🤖💀

---

## ⚡ Features That Make This Thing Dangerous

- **📰 Auto-Generates News** – Because reading is too mainstream.
- **🎨 Generates Images** – AI slaps text on a background and calls it art.
- **📸 Auto-Posts to Instagram** – Zero effort, maximum engagement.
- **🔒 Secure Credentials? Maybe** – We swear we didn’t push `config.json` (please don't check).
- **🔥 Dark Humor Mode** – Because news should make you cry and laugh at the same time.
