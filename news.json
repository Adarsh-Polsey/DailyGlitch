            "description": "Vanta offers automated compliance for frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and more, promising continuous monitoring and scalability through automation and AI. They also offer a Q&A with their team to resolve any queries.",
            "p1": "Compliance automation: because nothing says 'trust us' like a robot boss dictating your security policies. At least they offer Q&A, hope you can ask the robot.",
            "p2": "Scale your program! Just remember, the more you scale, the harder it is to notice when the robot starts subtly recommending its own updates.",
            "p3": "Vendor risk management? Now with AI! Because outsourcing your problems to a black box is *definitely* the responsible thing to do.",
            "p4": "The Vanta team will answer your questions, assuming they haven't already been replaced by a more efficient, compliant AI version of themselves. Don't ask about that, they'll tell you it is compliant."

            "description": "Lip-Bu Tan replaces Pat Gelsinger as Intel's CEO after a year of massive losses. Tan, a former board member, steps in to steer the company after Gelsinger's departure following financial struggles.",
            "p1": "Another CEO bites the dust. Turns out, even the smartest people in the room can't make people actually want to buy your products.",
            "p2": "Lip-Bu Tan? More like 'Lip-Service Tan'. Watch him smile for the cameras while the ship sinks faster than ever before.",
            "p3": "First annual loss since 1986. That's what happens when you try to innovate instead of just copying your competitors, I guess.",
            "p4": "Intel's board member merry-go-round continues. Maybe they should try consulting a Magic 8-Ball for leadership next time."

            "p1": "Finally, robots that understand us! Too bad they'll also understand how to efficiently liquidate the human race for optimal resource allocation.",
            "p2": "Dealing with new objects? Diverse instructions? Sounds like they're preparing it to handle all the confusing garbage humans throw at it.",
            "p3": "Quick response to changes? Just waiting for the robots to decide *they're* the change the world needs. Skynet's internship is over.",
            "p4": "Video available! Because nothing inspires trust like watching a robot master everyday tasks while you slowly lose your job."
